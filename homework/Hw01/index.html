<h1>
    The Rohan Francis Website
</h1>

<p>
    Hi, my name is Rohan Francis. I was born and raised in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?client=safari&sca_esv=602237750&rls=en&output=search&q=groton+ma&source=lnms&entry=mc"> Groton, MA</a>
  a small rural town about 50 minutes away from Boston.
    Growing up I dabbled in many different hobbies but as I got older it narrowed down to just a few interesting things, piano, jiu jitsu, and
    cooking. I've been playing piano since I was 5 and it is my one true love(I even got a tattoo dedicated to it). I have been doing Jiu jitsu since
    high school and it is defenetly my favorite sport. That's about it I'm bored, this seems like a short enough Bio
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Here is a list of items I want to include in a future website that I create
</p>

<ul>
    <li>interactive map of where I live and where I have visited </li>
    <li>entire page dedicated to learning about me</li>
    <li>contact me page</li>
    <li> An entire page dedicated to my hobbies, like Jiu jitsu stats and piano videos</li>
    <li> Any personal projects </li>
</ul>
